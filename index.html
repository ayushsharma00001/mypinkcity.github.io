                <p class="historypara">Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan state in India, was founded in 1727 by Maharaj
                    Sawai Jai Singh II, who ruled Jaipur State from 1699–1744. is the capital and largest city of the
                    Indian state of Rajasthan. As of 2011, the city had a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth
                    most populous city in the country. Jaipur is also known as the Pink City, due to the dominant colour
                    scheme of its buildings. <br> It is also known as the Paris of India,During the rule of Sawai Ram
                    Singh I, the city was painted pink to welcome HRH Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (who later became
                    King Edward VII, Emperor of India), in 1876.[16] Many of the avenues still remain painted in pink,
                    giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city. <br> Large areas of the city
                    including the airport were flooded in August 1981, resulting in the death of eight people and much
                    damage to the city's Dravyavati River.[20] The floods were caused by three days of cloud burst that
                    produced more rain than the annual average</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="historypara"><strong>Climate:</strong>Jaipur has a monsoon-influenced hot semi-arid climate
                    (Köppen climate classification BSh) with long, extremely hot summers and short, mild to warm
                    winters. Annual precipitation is over 63 cm, falling mostly in July and August due to monsoon,
                    causing the average temperatures in these two months to be lower compared to drier May and June.
                    <br> During the monsoon, there are frequent, heavy rains and thunderstorms, but flooding is not
                    common.

                    attracts several tourists, lot of businesses groom here as well. <br> World Trade Park fits
                    extremely well in this situation where people can go to a modern shopping mall and shop the brands
                    they need. Very well built and maintained, food courts have lot to offer. <br>The Jaipur Modern
                    boutique stocks products that put a contemporary, worldly twist on the region’s highly-skilled
                    artisan craft traditions—so it’s fitting that the shop’s restaurant does something similar on the
                    culinary front. Committed to partnering with organic and sustainable farms, individual farmers, and
                    agricultural projects—as well as maintaining its own farm—the Kitchen incorporates fresh local
                    ingredients into a globally-influenced menu, resulting in dishes like pizza topped with free-range
                    chicken, spiced couscous, potato rosti with farm-fresh poached eggs, and a lengthy list of cold
                    pressed juices.</p>
